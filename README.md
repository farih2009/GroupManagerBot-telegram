# GroupManagerBot-telegram
A just-for-fun telegram bot to remind people to mind their language in group chats. (Built for Hack&Roll 2018)

## Inspiration
When we were deciding what to do, we wanted to create a Telegram bot and got inspiration from our dear friend Francis, who is a fairly *annoying* person but does not like the use of uncouth language. Hence, we created a Telegram bot as an attempt to replicate his behaviour.

## What it does
- Prompts you not to use uncouth language when a word in the banned list is used
- A random word will be added to the banned list everyday
- Users can redeem themselves by refraining from using banned words over a number of messages sent
- The use of certain words will prompt the bot to send related song lyrics
- Randomly decides to remind chat users of the number of days until finals (what a killjoy)
- Randomly decides to send chat users pictures of Francis (just to be annoying)
- Users will get kicked out the chat with a chance proportional to their banned words count  
#### Commands:  
- /start: Introduces you to the bot
- /naughtyList: Leaderboard to show the number of banned words used for the top 10 users
- /banned: Shows the banned list of words on the command
- /add or /remove: allows users to add or remove banned words except the default ones
- /joke: tells users a joke
- /halp: shows all the available commands
